# How to use the files in this directory

The directory structure in `files/` is meant to be used with `stow` to symlink the configs to the relevant parts of the system. They are also used with nixos modules in the `nix/` directory. There is a `flake.nix` flake file in this repo to be used with nixos.

`doom-emacs` is listed in this repository as a submodule, for ease of use with non-nixos systems.
