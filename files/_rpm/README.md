# Fedora Package Management & Configuration

These files contain install commands for packages that should be installed on all fedora35 installs, as well as optional groups of packages (media, games, etc). For now, just pipe each file to bash/zsh to run the installs, a better system will be put in place later. 

## TODO
- TODO: add section for hypervisor
- TODO: write a script that manages installs
