# Hardware Modules

These were selectively pulled from https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/ instead of using the flake, since I wanted to edit a few of them. Maybe I'll move to the flake at some point. 

Individual device configurations in `devices/`, create modules as-needed in other directories.
